## A Bit About Me

Welcome to my site. I'm Frank. (he/him/they)

I work for a large bank as a BISO, business information security officer, serving as a bridge between Security and Operations. My experience has largely been in the financial sector on the GRC side of the security house. Over the years I've found I'm not great at the actual hands on keyboard engineering and hacking side of security, but I can grok and communicate the technical, the business, and the risk well enough that I fit well in "bridge" roles between functions. 

Away from the desk: I'm trying to foster the hacker mindset in a tiny human. I'm a mediocre runner, 5k being my preferred distance. I enjoy video games and the study of game theory. I love a good beer or whiskey and will gladly take recommendations. And I'm a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Arsenal FC, and Borussia Dortmund. 

My [Blog](/blog/) is for sharing of things, both found and experienced, both Security/GRC and frivolity. I am not a thought leader, I'm not famous on Infosec Twitter, I just want to give back something(s) that someone(s) might derive value from. Also found here are a running [Reading](/reading/) and study list, and I keep conference talks and other dopamine-chasing in [Projects](/projects/).

If you're going to consume some of my writing, kick your feet up and grab a drink of your choosing, you've probably earned it. I hope that it will make me appear a better author than I truly am. If you found something here useful, [let me know!](https://twitter.com/BeerMetalPC) 

## What's the name mean?

I have another unique handle I‚Äôve used for online gaming purposes for years, but as I‚Äôve started doing more public and professional interaction, it became clear I needed another that was separate or at least at arms length from my gaming activity. BeerMetalPC was a half-asleep showerthought: you‚Äôve heard of a bare metal computer. What about beer metal? üç∫ü§òüíª.

## Upcoming Conferences
 I try to attend at least one security conference per year. You can see which ones I'll be at, and whether I'm doing anything more than just attending, (volunteering, speaking, etc.) below. Feel free to say hi if we cross paths!

### Blue Team Con 2022
I will be attending [Blue Team Con](https://blueteamcon.com/) again this year, August 27 and 28. 
If you find yourself in Chicago on Thursday August 25 before the conference, consider coming to [Burbsec East.](https://burbsec.com/#groups)
