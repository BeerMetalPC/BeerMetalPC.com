## A Bit About Me

Hey there, I'm Frank. (he/him/they)

I work for a large bank as a Business Information Security Officer, or "BISO", serving as a bridge between our Security and Operations organizations. My experience has largely been on the GRC side of the security shop, with dalliances in M&A due diligance, and STRIDE-based threat modeling. I've found I'm not great at the actual hands on keyboard engineering and hacking side of security, but I can grok and communicate the technical, the business, and the risk well enough that I fit well in "bridge" roles between functions. 

Away from the desk: I'm trying to foster the hacker mindset in a tiny human. I'm a mediocre runner, 5k being my preferred distance. I enjoy video games and the study of game theory. I love a good beer or whiskey and will gladly take recommendations. And I'm a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Arsenal FC, and Borussia Dortmund. 

My [Blog](/blog/) is for sharing of things, both found and experienced, both Security/GRC and frivolity. I am not a thought leader and I'm not famous on Infosec Twitter, I just occaisonally chase dopamine hits by writing and hope that said writing provides something that someone might derive value from. Also found here are a running [reading](/reading/) and study list. I keep conference talks and other hands-on extracirriculars in [Projects](/tag-project/).

If you're going to consume anything from this site, I recommend that you kick your feet up and grab a drink of your choosing; you've probably earned it. If you found something here useful, [let me know!](https://twitter.com/BeerMetalPC) 

## What's the name mean?

I have another unique handle I‚Äôve used for online gaming purposes for years, but as I‚Äôve started doing more public and professional interaction, it became clear I needed another that was separate or at least at arms length from my gaming activity. BeerMetalPC was a half-asleep showerthought: you‚Äôve heard of a bare metal computer. What about beer metal? üç∫ü§òüíª.

## Upcoming Conferences
 I try to attend at least one security conference per year. You can see which ones I'll be at, and whether I'm doing anything more than just attending, (volunteering, speaking, etc.) below. Feel free to say hi if we cross paths!

### Blue Team Con 2022
I will be volunteering at [Blue Team Con](https://blueteamcon.com/) this year, August 27-28, 2022.
If you find yourself in Chicago on Thursday August 25 prior to the conference, consider coming out to our local and unrelated infosec meetup: [Burbsec East.](https://burbsec.com/#groups)
