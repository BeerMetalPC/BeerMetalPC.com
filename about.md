Hey there, I'm Frank (he/him/they).

At the desk: I'm a Business Information Security Officer, or "BISO", serving as a bridge between our security and operations organizations. My experience has largely been on the GRC side of cybersecurity, with detours through M&A and threat modeling. I've found over the years that I'm not great at programming, and consequently not at red teaming, but I grok and communicate the technical, business, risk facets such that I fit well in "bridge" roles between organizations. 

Away from the desk: 
- I'm trying to foster the hacker mindset in two tiny humans. 
- I'm a mediocre runner, 5k being my preferred distance, and help maintain a running Meetup group in Chicago.
- I enjoy games; video, tabletop, the study of game theory. I ran a large Destiny 2 community for several years, I've written about that [here](/blog/2022-06-04-Ferrous-Core-Pt1). 
- I really like a good beer or whiskey and will gladly take recommendations. 
- I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and am now figuring out what/if/how that impacts other parts of my life. 
- I'm a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Arsenal, and Borussia Dortmund; I can sometimes be found amidst the [Chicago Gooners](https://www.chicagogooners.com/). 

This [Blog](/blog/) is for sharing of things, both found and experienced, both security/GRC and frivolity. I am not a thought leader, I'm not famous on Infosec ~~Twitter~~ Mastodon, but sometimes my ever-ongoing dopamine chase requires writing and I can but hope something appears here that someone might derive value from. Also found here are a running [reading](/reading/) and study list, and any conference talks or hands-on extracirriculars in [Projects](/tag-project/).

If you're going to consume anything from this site, I recommend that you kick your feet up and grab a drink of your choosing; you've probably earned it. If you found something here useful, [let me know!](https://bsky.app/profile/beermetalpc.bsky.social)

## What's the name mean?

BeerMetalPC was a half-asleep showerthought. You've heard of bare metal computers? What about beer metal? üç∫ü§òüíª.
I‚Äôve used other handles for online games over the years, but as I‚Äôve started doing more public and professional interaction, it became clear I needed one more that was at arms length from my gaming activity. 
Is my personal branding a mess as a result? Yes. üòÜ

## Upcoming Conferences
I try to attend at least one security conference per year. You can see which ones I'll be at, and whether I'm doing anything more than just attending, (volunteering, speaking, etc.) below. Feel free to say hi if we cross paths!

### Blue Team Con
I was unable to attend Blue Team Con 2023 due to the birth of my second child coinciding with the conference. I intend to be back, and volunteering again, in 2024.
