Hi folks. I'm Frank. ðŸ‘‹

I work in cybersecurity as a business information security officer (BISO), with a background primarily on the GRC side of security, and have worked in this field for about seven years at the time of this post. Head on over to [About](/about/) if you want more of the bits about me. 

The itch set in to finally build a personal website and make something of a project out of it, something I could both learn from building and host content on going forward, without having to spend a ton of time maintaining it or paying inconveniently high hosting fees. This is the result; I've gone into some further detail as a blog post here: [BeerMetalPC.com](/blog/2022-03-11-ThisWebsite)

I've been trying to overcome my own apprehensions and find more ways to participate in the broader security community: conferences, meetups, infosec twitter, and the like. (Admittedly, not great timing to have this drive in the midst of a global pandemic....) I've done a little writing in the past, primarily about things relating to video games and online communities. Writing has been a semi-consistent means for me to give back or add value in those fields, and I feel I'm now reaching a point professionally where I may have experiences or content worth sharing in the security space.  I've struggled to come to grips with posting content publicly in the past. I can only assume my comfort level is greater this time around by having control over the content and how it's presented. Rather than being hosted on a behemoth of a site or service, the personal site format feels available, but comfortable, if that makes sense. 

While I will post security content here, it also won't be the exclusive focus. Games and other personal interests may appear here. To that end, I've pre-populated this site with some of my old content back-dated to reflect when I last worked on it, as well as [a potential conference talk](/blog/2022-01-01-HereThereAreMonsters) that I've been working on more recently. 

I don't anticipate any set schedule or frequency of posting, if I have something longer than a tweet I want to share, or if I've gotten a project or conference talk idea to a point I feel comfortable making public, I'll share it here and post a link to [my Twitter, @BeerMetalPC](https://twitter.com/BeerMetalPC) That's also the best way to get ahold of me if you have questions, requests, feedback, or just want to carry on a conversation or memery. 

Welcome, thanks for reading, and if you ever find something of value to you here do let me know. 

Cheers, 

Frank
