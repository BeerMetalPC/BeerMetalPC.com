caption:     A conference talk about lessons learned working on M&A projects, and steps you can take to prepare for one now. 
description: >
   In the year 2021, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity worldwide topped an overall annual value of $5.63 trillion US dollars, shattering the previous record set in 2007. Yet despite increases in both the volume and value of M&A activity in our economy, public knowledge sharing by security practitioners about acquisition and divestiture projects, and more importantly their lessons learned, are both scant and difficult to find.
   In this talk, we take a retrospective view of the speaker's experience as the information security "delivery lead" for M&A projects in a large financial institution. We'll summarize their lessons learned, what worked and what can be done better, and impart practical steps you as a security practitioner can take now to be prepared for an M&A activity and/or to support your organization's existing M&A practice. Asking "what if?" now will prevent a lot of last minute scrambling, hair on fire, and "that's not in my budget!"-ing later.

## Context

Here There Are Monsters is the first conference talk I've worked on and originated as a lightbulb moment. Following Blue Team Con 2021 I was considering whether I've had any experience worthy of a con talk, and my thoughts kept landing on M&A projects. I've made multiple efforts to search for lessons learned or advice from security practitioners who have done similar work, and sadly I have found nearly nothing. M&A delivery is a side of security that either few have done, or at least few talk about. 

Unfortunately, I have not yet had occaison to give this talk in any formal or public setting, but I am making my slides available for the sake of open knowledge sharing. Sitting on this material waiting to win the CFP lottery would feel irresponsible. I started in this role knowing nothing about the M&A process in general, let alone how security fit into it, and I want the next bright eyed analyst that falls over backwards into this type of role to have a better footing to start from than I had. 

## Resources
