Hey, I'm Frank (He/Him/They). Welcome to my site. 

I work in cybersecurity and sometimes I post things longer than 240 characters, which I'm told counts as a blog. 
 Such things are here and are likely to include cybersecurity, risk, games, or just anything else I get the itch to post. 
 If you want to know more about the guy behind the keyboard, check out [About](/about/).  

If you have questions, comments, or just need to get a hold of me, [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@BeerMetalPC) (public), [Email (PGP available)](mailto:email@BeerMetalPC.com), or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/beermetalpc) (private) are your most reliable options.
