 Welcome to my site. I work in cybersecurity and sometimes I post things longer than a tweet, which I'm told counts as a blog. 
 So it's here, it's likely to include security, games, or just anything else I get the itch to post. 
 If you want to know more about the guy behind the keyboard, head over to [About](/about/).
