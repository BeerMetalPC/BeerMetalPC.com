## Commitment to Privacy

This website and its operator do not collect personally identifiable information at any point or by any means. I do not collect your data, therefore I do not have access to your data, and I cannot modify or delete it. 

This website does rely on and make use of other services which ***may*** collect personal data. I have made a best effort to inventory these additional services, see section [Third Parties](/LEGAL/#third-parties) below. Any inquiries about personal data collected or held by third-party sites/services must be directed to those third parties directly. 

## First Party

No cookies are collected or stored by this site or its operator. 

No advertising is served via this site. And besides, you should be running an adblocker anyway. 

Google Fonts are not used on this site. 

Cloudflare is not used by this site.

## Third Parties

This site is hosted on Netlify, which may collect identifiers, cookies, and website usage data. If you have specific questions about Netlify's data collection practices, review their [Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy) and [GDPR/CCPA Policy](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa) for further information and resources. 

### Embeds 

This site may include embeds from other websites. As a preemptive measure, I provide here the privacy policy or most relevant policy of the services from which I have embedded content previously or anticipate doing so in the future. 

- Threads : [Threads Privacy Policy](https://terms.threads.com/privacy-policy)
- Mastodon : As Mastodon relies on multiple instances brought together via federation, Terms of Service and Privacy Policies may vary from instance to instance. I link here to [infosec.exchange's privacy policy](https://infosec.exchange/privacy-policy), as it is the instance I interact with most and am most likely to embed any posts from. 
- Twitter/X : [Twitter for Websites - ads info and privacy](https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy). Note that as of 2023 I no longer make use of Twitter/X and have deleted my account.
- YouTube : [Privacy Enhanced Mode](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en) is utilized wherever a YouTube embed is present on this site. 

You may be trackable through external links to other websites. Websites and services other than this site and their cross-site tracking methods are outside the scope of this privacy statement. You must do your own due diligence in this regard.
